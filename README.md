# What is bundled.media?

## A gateway to Christian media

Bundled.media is a software product that is a gateway to the vast landscape of Christian media. It aggregates and normalizes the media meta data. The media itself such as the video or audio files are not touched, this product is only about meta data. It makes it possible to filter by language code (bcp47), a search term, media type and hopefully in the future by category.

When media is used, we want to send back usage statistics to the meia publisher. 

## Usage statistics for media consumers

What if consumers could see what media is often used? We want to create a way to have insight into the statistics.

## Notifications for new media

Would it be possible to subscribe to a search query, so that when new content is found you can get a notification?

## A global taxonomy to categorize media
